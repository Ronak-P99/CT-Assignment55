If import doesnt work:


Try to do the following:
Deactivate all the venv by using the "deactivate" command in the terminal
Delete the venvâ€¯folder and then create a new one with "python3 -m venv venv"
Activate the new venv with "source venv/bin/activate"
Install the packages with pip "pip install -r requirements.txt"
